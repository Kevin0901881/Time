# Time
This was my first attempt at coding an Android app, called Time. I began and ended this as a side project in grade 11 as a stepping stone into Android development. I learned Java, then specifically Android development, through digesting a series of online tutorials and reading pages upon pages of questions and responses on Stackoverflow. My intention was to develop a simple and functional application and accumulate experience and knowledge along the way. In hindsight, I realize I could have coded the app in a much more efficient and better documented manner. In fact, I believe many of the repetitive methods I created, a prime example of which are the animations, could have been done with only one or two, programmed in a separated class so they could be used in multiple different parts of my app. There also exist a few incomplete features and a few bugs in the app that I absolutely could not find due to the lack of documentation. This was however, an excellent learning experience. I've undoubtedly plunged over a hundred hours into this project over many months - first it was to learn Java, then Android development, then I had to design the UI, and finally code and debug. I've transferred this experience into my current project: Glide, a puzzle-style Android game that will be making its way into the market in the near future!
